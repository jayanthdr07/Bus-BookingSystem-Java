# 🚌 Bus Booking System (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Bus Booking System** is a Java-based console application that simulates a real-time bus ticket booking process. It allows users to select routes, bus types, travel dates, number of seats, and enter passenger details, finally generating a complete ticket with fare calculation.

This project demonstrates **core Java concepts**, **logical conditions**, **arrays**, and **user interaction using Scanner**.

## 🚀 Features
- Multiple source and destination routes
- Three bus types:
  - AC Sleeper
  - Semi Sleeper
  - Seater
- Real-time seat selection
- Passenger detail entry (Name, Gender, Contact)
- Automatic fare calculation
- Transport tax (5%) calculation
- Ticket and receipt generation
